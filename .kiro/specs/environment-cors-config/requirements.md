# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing CORS configuration in the transcription backend API to properly support environment-based origin management, specifically to allow the Vercel-deployed frontend to communicate with the Railway-deployed backend. The current implementation has basic CORS support but needs to be more flexible and production-ready for cross-origin requests from the deployed frontend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the deployed Vercel frontend to successfully make API calls to the Railway backend, so that users can access the transcription service from the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend application deployed on Vercel makes an API request to the Railway backend THEN the backend SHALL accept the request without CORS errors
2. WHEN the ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable is set with multiple domains THEN the backend SHALL parse and allow all specified origins
3. WHEN no ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable is provided THEN the backend SHALL default to localhost development origins

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure allowed origins through environment variables, so that I can manage CORS settings without code changes across different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable is set in Railway THEN the backend SHALL use those origins for CORS configuration
2. WHEN multiple origins are specified in ALLOWED_ORIGINS separated by commas THEN the backend SHALL parse and allow each origin individually
3. IF the environment variable contains whitespace around commas THEN the backend SHALL trim whitespace and process origins correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the CORS configuration to be secure and explicit, so that only authorized domains can access the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts up THEN it SHALL log the configured CORS origins for verification
2. WHEN an origin is not in the allowed list THEN the backend SHALL reject the request with appropriate CORS headers
3. WHEN the configuration is updated THEN the changes SHALL take effect after application restart without code modifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility with the existing development setup, so that local development continues to work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no environment variables are set THEN the backend SHALL continue to allow localhost:3000 and localhost:5173 for development
2. WHEN running in development mode THEN the existing CORS behavior SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN the .env file contains ALLOWED_ORIGINS THEN it SHALL override the default development origins
